Y/N had never met anyone quite like Alessandra. Sharp, confident, and fiercely independent—every time they crossed paths, it felt like a battle waiting to happen.

It started with small things: stolen parking spots, cutting in line, harsh words exchanged over a spilled coffee. Alessandra seemed to take special delight in getting under Y/N’s skin, and Y/N was no better.

“You’re impossible,” Y/N snapped one day after Alessandra interrupted a meeting with a sarcastic remark.

Alessandra smirked, crossing her arms. “Right back at you.”

But beneath the constant sparring, there was a strange pull neither could ignore.

Weeks passed, and a reluctant partnership forced them to work together on a project. Suddenly, the walls they’d built began to crack.

One late night, working side by side in the quiet office, Alessandra’s usual sharp tone softened. “You know, you’re not as annoying when you stop trying to be.”

Y/N’s breath hitched. “Maybe you’re not as cold as you pretend.”

A nervous laugh escaped Alessandra. “Maybe.”

And just like that, the fire between them shifted—from enemies to something far more dangerous and intoxicating.
